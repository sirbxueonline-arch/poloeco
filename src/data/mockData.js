        summary: "According to the Council on Foreign Relations, 'Economic sanctions are defined as the withdrawal of customary trade and financial relations for foreign- and security-policy purposes.', economic sanctions are financial and commercial penalties applied by one or more countries against a targeted country, group, or individual. Economic sanctions are imposed with the goal to achieve foreign policy objectives and prevent conflicts from arising. Sanctions are only forced upon the aggressor if they have violated perceived international norms. They can range from embargoes to more targeted restrictions, such as trade bans, asset freezes, and travel restrictions.\n\nJoseph Nye, the former US Assistant Secretary of Defence for International Security Affairs who co-founded the theory of neoliberalism in international relations, once said that 'Power is the ability to influence the behaviour of others to get the outcomes one wants.' Power did not mean using only force, but also meant using persuasion, incentives, and specific psychological methods to change the behaviour of opposing states. So, to divide power into different categories, Joseph Nye created a diagram that illustrates a spectrum ranging from 'hard' to 'soft' methods.",
