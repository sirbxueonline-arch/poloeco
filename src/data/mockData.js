        summary: "According to the Council on Foreign Relations, 'Economic sanctions are defined as the withdrawal of customary trade and financial relations for foreign- and security-policy purposes.', economic sanctions are financial and commercial penalties applied by one or more countries against a targeted country, group, or individual. Economic sanctions are imposed with the goal to achieve foreign policy objectives and prevent conflicts from arising. Sanctions are only forced upon the aggressor if they have violated perceived international norms. They can range from embargoes to more targeted restrictions, such as trade bans, asset freezes, and travel restrictions.\n\nJoseph Nye, the former US Assistant Secretary of Defence for International Security Affairs who co-founded the theory of neoliberalism in international relations, once said that 'Power is the ability to influence the behaviour of others to get the outcomes one wants.' Power did not mean using only force, but also meant using persuasion, incentives, and specific psychological methods to change the behaviour of opposing states. So, to divide power into different categories, Joseph Nye created a diagram that illustrates a spectrum ranging from 'hard' to 'soft' methods.",

        fullText: `From the numbers given in figure 8, it can be confidently concluded that Russia's energy exports have been shifted towards Asian markets, particularly China and India as a result of Western sanctions continuing to restrict trade between Russia and Europe. In coal exports, China buys almost 46% of total exports. India follows with 17% by buying discounted Russian coal to support its growing energy demands thanks to their huge population. This shows their close economic ties with Russia for both countries. Turkey, even though accounting for only 11% is a crucial customer as they also export the Russian non-renewable resources worldwide. Similarly with crude oil, China and India together make up a huge percentage of 84% of Russian exports, purchasing 47% and India 37% respectively.
        
        While Asian countries take the lead in coal and crude oil purchases, Europe’s reliance on Russia for other energy forms is still visible from figure 8. The EU remains the largest buyer of Russia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG), accounting for 48% of exports, and still imports 40% of Russia’s pipeline gas. These trends demonstrate Russia’s strategic turn of energy trade towards non-Western markets, with countries like China, India, and Turkey, helping Russia’s economy survive. This independence from Western countries also shows that Russia is far better without US and European governments money thanks to the strengthened economic bonds between Asian nations and Russia.
        
        Conclusion
        To conclude, economic sanctions have indeed had a huge impact on Russia’s economy. With Western countries observing the Ukrainian war unfold, more sanctions are imposed with the aim to create fluctuations in Russia’s economy. The sanctions are added with packages, targeting key sectors, such as banking, energy, and defense, and included asset freezes, trade restrictions, and prohibitions on luxury goods. The Russian ruble experienced a significant depreciation, which led to inflation, ultimately causing higher costs for everyday goods, and a decline in living standards for many citizens. Industries such as automobiles and oil refineries suffered from increased production costs and limited access to foreign markets. While these sanctions were designed to pressure the Russian government and reduce its capacity to wage war, they have also created economic instability, job losses, and social unrest for ordinary Russians.
        
        What’s more is that Russia’s Central Bank raising interest rates to quiet down inflation has further damaged the economy, making borrowing more expensive for both businesses and individuals. In a different perspective, western sanctions have significantly changed how Russia used to export energy. The sanctions have made Russia friendlier with non-Western countries, exposing the limitations of economic penalties. The recent shift toward Asian markets, particularly China and India, reflects Russia’s survival and adaptation skills to its current situation. The western world still depends on Russian LNG and pipeline gas, demonstrating how countries have their own interdependencies. To achieve peace in Ukraine, is to be able to effectively stop Russia from assaulting the Crimea region. This can only be achieved if the whole world agrees on cutting off Russia economically and politically, stripping them away from alternatives.`
